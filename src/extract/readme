This folder contains all of the code for extracting image data from Visual Genome.

This step was completed by Elan Markov.

The files consist of the VG API, along with the "extract" source files.

The sample files will generate a small snippet to understand the style of the output.

The extract_full.py will extract all data from the JSON files. Note that the JSON files
are very large, so they are not included. A download link is given in the extract_full.py
comments. Significant memory (>20 GB) is needed to successfully process all JSON files.
